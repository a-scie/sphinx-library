Library Sphinx Theme
====================

Library is a minimal typography-centric theme for the `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation system, designed to read like a good
book. Features include:

* Publisher-selectable typeface stacks.

* User-selectable light/sepia/dark reading modes.

* Mobile-friendly responsive design.

Design
------

"Library" is inspired by design of the printed page. Black and white, without
colors, embellishments, or icons --- for a good book the typography itself is
the only source of design. "Library" returns to these literary roots by keeping
colors, shapes, and frills to a minimum --- focusing instead on whitespace and
typography to produce legible, daresay *enjoyable*, documentation. This is a
refreshed Sphinx theme for font nerds with a focus on legibility and long-form
reading.

Typeface Stacks
---------------

Several hand-tuned font stacks are included to change the feel of your
documentation. Each features carefully selected typeface pairings which have
been balanced with the theme layout to create a book-like reading experience.

* **Book** --- Highly legible type inspired by printed books. The default, and
  good for general purpose use.

* **Humanist** --- Another highly legible type, with a fresh and more casual
  look.

* **Academy** --- An elegant and formal early 20th-century type favored by
  academic publications and legal documents.

* **Engineer** --- A semi-slab-serif type; formal but much cleaner and more
  modern than "academy".

* **Swiss** --- Sans-serif type providing an austere but clean look.
